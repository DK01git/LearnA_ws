      "How I Became a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador | by Asiri Sirithunga | Bootcamp | Medium Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Sign up Sign in How I Became a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Asiri Sirithunga · Follow Published in Bootcamp · 5 min read · Apr 7, 2023 -- Listen Share I decided to write my story of becoming a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. This is one of my achievements as a volunteer engineering undergraduate here in Sri Lanka. One year long memories in the global ambassadors community are exciting and worthwhile. My work within the community was recognized and I was nominated as a Gold milestone achiever. Gold announcement at Town Hall call My application to join the program was accepted at the beginning of the year 2022. The good news was emailed to me by the program team. The ambassador journey of mine began at this point. I’m sharing my experience with all the readers out there while having an intention of influencing the community around me and clearing the doubts of new ambassadors in the community including new, alpha and beta ambassadors. Happy reading! I completed the onboarding process as quickly as possible. In my time, onboarding consisted of a unique set of tasks including setting up the Microsoft teams, joining the town hall call, etc. The excitement was always there with me. Then I advanced to the alpha milestone after successful completion of the microsoft learn module and actively participating in a league event. I was able to finish the technical onboarding at the same time. Can you imagine how excited I was at the time? Wow! I was just impressed with my progress. It motivated me to learn more about the program and contribute my best to the community. Program team provided us with a Visual studio code enterprise subscription including azure credit, linkedin learning voucher and many more. I’m keen on experimenting new technologies in my leisure time, because of that I utilized my credit in experimenting with azure services. Everything related to azure is properly documented in an understandable way. So, It’s not that harsh to start learning cloud with azure. The next milestone for me was beta. There were two challenging requirements to satisfy. One challenge was hosting a virtual event on a microsoft related technology vertical. I chose it at first rather than going for a social impact project league. I planned my event on Microsoft Power BI. It’s an integrated data visualization tool which facilitates most of the phases of data analysis process. I had been learning the tool for a while during a remote internship I completed as an intern data science analyst with the Plan4CO team. I followed the instructions given and scheduled the event on teams. I delivered an introduction to the data analysis process and demonstrated how to design a dashboard using Power BI to meet the requirements of a given task. Demonstrated Dashboard The pre-planning and marketing were challenging but I managed to reach the required level, but in the end things went bad. Somehow I missed the recording and the event didn’t meet the requirements. Program team approved my event and encouraged me to organize another one to reach my milestone. It was a great experience for me because I realized that anything bad could happen at any time in life without even noticing them in advance. I moved forward with my second event. It was not as challenging as the first time hence I had already gone through it. I signed up for a peer-mentorship program and social impact project at the same time. My first social impact project was not successful but the mentorship event was a success. We all together organized and delivered a session on cloud computing. Our mentor helped a lot to make it happen. A new chapter of my ambassador journey began after I reached the beta milestone. I shared my achievement on social media. It is an excellent practice which motivates colleagues in your network. Beta Swags I continued participating in social impact projects as it improved my skills and introduced me to new enthusiastic friends living in different continents of the world. One of my projects was a blog series on Power BI and machine learning. I met many like-minded people while working with them on these projects. It was an opportunity of a lifetime. Microsoft offered Credly badges in recognition of each member’s contribution. Credly Badge I’m passionate about learning new technologies and applying them in solving real world problems. Therefore I utilized my spare time to learn and certified my competency in tech. The program offered me an opportunity to take the AZ-900 azure fundamentals exam for free. So, I referred to all the materials available on the learn page and went through linkedin learning courses relevant to the topic as preparations. I have shared my experience taking AZ-900 here on medium as a separate blog. Credly Badge In the latter part of the year 2022, I actively volunteered as an organizing team member of the Microsoft Ignite community lead after party of Sri Lanka, which was conducted as a hybrid event. Since the beginning of the planning phase, I worked with the Gold ambassadors of the community and shared and discussed my addons. I took the responsibility to share the event details among my university students. I used mostly social media and word of mouth. I found many potential candidates for the coming cohort who helped me to spread the news. In the physical event I gave my contribution as a track owner. Azure Infrastructure and Security was my track, and I had the responsibility to make that track an insightful one. It was challenging hence, this was the first event I contributed physically after the long break of covid-19 for two years. Reaching out to the speakers was one of my duties at the day. Some speakers participated physically and virtually from several parts of the globe. One of our MVPs joined from the Netherlands virtually. The full transition of the event raised some novel challenges but they were manageable with the help of my team.

      "Ambassador Chung said, “I was inspired by meeting the two teams from Sri Lanka, who have brought noteworthy recognition to the country through their skills and capabilities. Innovation is a driving force for transformative change, and it is key to Sri Lanka in building a sustainable and prosperous economy. Microsoft’s efforts in cultivating technological excellence through platforms such as the Microsoft Imagine Cup are remarkable, and they highlight the bright future possible in Sri Lanka and beyond.”\n",
      "Added Sook Hoon Cheah, general manager, Microsoft Southeast Asia New Markets, “It was a fantastic opportunity for the two Sri Lankan teams to connect with Ambassador Chung and share their inspirations in creating inclusive projects using cutting-edge technology. Their innovations towards solving real-world problems are an inspiration to all and have the power to change the lives of many. The potential that these students have shown through their original tech innovations is proof of what Sri Lanka has to offer towards digital acceleration and being an active contributor in achieving a global digital economy.”\n",

      "Today we’d like to introduce Gihan Siriwardhana who is from Sri Lanka and graduated recently from the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology.\n",
      "Responses have been edited for clarity and length.\n",
      "When you joined the community in 2019, did you have specific goals you wanted to reach, such as a particular skill or quality?  What were they?  Did you achieve them? How has the program impacted you in general?\n",
      "When I started my undergraduate life, talking in front of a larger crowd was a nightmare to me. So, I identified my lack of social skills and wanted to improve myself. Also, I was really interested in cloud technologies and wanted to follow a more practical path toward learning new technologies.  I saw that being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador could help me to achieve both of my biggest goals. After three years, I can now talk in front of any number of people without preparation, and I am working as a software engineer because of my knowledge and experience in cloud technologies.\n",
      "What are the accomplishments that you’re the proudest of and why?\n",
      "At my university, two other seniors and I created a society called the Microsoft Club to bridge the gap between undergraduate life and life as a professional. I was the first president, and now it is one of the most well-known societies in the university. Also, we managed to spread the concept to a few other universities as well, so we now have around 6 Microsoft Clubs in Sri Lanka, and we all worked together to achieve great goals.\n",
      "One other accomplishment that I am very proud is that I organized an event along with fellow Student Ambassadors from Sri Lanka called the Cloud Skills Challenge. The event ran at the same time at 10 universities all over Sri Lanka with about 1000 participants who were trying to win Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals exam vouchers.\n",
      "What’s next for you?  What have you been you doing after graduation?\n",
      "I have started my career as a software engineer at Sysco LABS Technologies, which develops the main solution for Sysco, but I will always continue my journey in helping others and raising awareness of new technologies.\n",
      "If you could redo your time with the Student Ambassadors community, is there anything you would have done differently?\n",
      "I don't think so because everything worked perfectly well, and I am proud that I have supported the next generation to continue the good work. But maybe, since we were not allowed to have in-person events for very long after I joined, I would have organized a few more in-person events before the pandemic.\n",
      "If you were to describe the community to a student who is interested in joining, what would you say about it to convince him or her to join?\n",
      "Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors is a member-driven community which helps members to improve their technical as well as soft skills while creating a network with people who have the same interests. Also, it comes with attractive benefits such as Cloud Advocate advisors, Azure credits, swag and endless learning content and opportunities.\n",
      "What advice would you give to new Student Ambassadors?\n",
      "Do not consider this as just another accomplishment to add to your resume, but an opportunity that very few people receive where they can do lot of good things. Use this opportunity to give back to the community, help people in need, and of course improve yourself.\n",
      "Do you have a motto in life, a guiding principle that drives you?\n",
      "Never stop learning. Learn, practice and teach. Then success will follow you.\n",
      "What is one random fact few people know about you?\n",
      "I am very passionate to solve problems and love to find solutions for impossible questions.  One time, a lecturer from my university discussed a problem he was having. The lecturer wanted to create cloud spaces that could only be accessed by a group of four. For years, he was doing it manually and it took his team about two weeks, I gave it a thought and created a Power Shell script to do this automatically under 5 minutes, and I added a functionality to link them to Microsoft Teams too.  This script is still being used today, and I get a thank you email every time it’s used.\n",
      "Also, I absolutely love camping, and I have a cat called “Mickey” and a dog called “Trace”.\n",

Learn more > Blog Post Educator Developer Blog 2 MIN READ From Village Dreams to Global Impact: My Journey as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Nirajan_Acharya Copper Contributor Oct 21, 2024 Hi I'm Nirajan Acharya  and student ambassador from Nepal studying Computer Engineering. I am grew up in a small village, but when I was there I remember life was very simple and dreams seemed out of reach. The first tech gift my father gave me was a small dummy phone, when I turned twelve. Sure, it was just a toy, but that simple toy to me set off a curiosity for stuff like this that would persist throughout my life.\n",
      "Growing up, although we all have dreams of what we want to be when we grow older, as I got older and learned more, I knew that I wanted something meaningful- not just for me but to the society where I belong, to the soil which feed me. One day I found Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program while surfing the web. Then, I applied for this program thinking that it will definitely prepare what I wanted to.\n",
      "For me, joining the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) program has opened a world of opportunities. This is not just in program and facilities which I received and learning journey, but also all about how one can give back to the world. This journey inspired me to volunteer and be the driver of changes in community. It has inspired to contribute somethings to the world where I live and try to share happiness. Due to impact of this, I have freely volunteered more than ten international projects helping them to save thousands of dollars through my skills with the sole goal of making a positive change in the lives of others.\n",
      "Gradually, I started giving free of cost training to students in various colleges; imparting the knowledge and skills: I was doing my part. In my every summer and winter holidays, I came back to stay in my village and trained people about different digital tools and the most recent one is about training on how to effectively use social medias and AI tools (related to cyber-security) with a aim to provide knowledge on using technology effectively and safely.\n",
      "On this vacation, I designed a web-based emergency response app to be used in my municipality which will help people in need.  I also hand over this app freely to my municipality and receives an honor of certificate from municipality for my work as it helps to bring a massive positive impact on the emergency situation.\n",
      "It was a moment of realization for me — from an inquisitive village kid to being capable of giving back. My life is so different now, as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. It was the lesson that where ever you come from, with hard work and the right circumstances, you can bring light to people. I hope this story can help others realize their potential and use it to uplift your community as well.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, the demand for skilled professionals in technology is at an all-time high. In Sri Lanka, the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program is playing a transformative role in nurturing the next generation of tech innovators. This initiative not only equips university students with technical skills but also empowers them to take charge of their communities through leadership and collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Growing Participation and Community Impact\n",
      "### The Rise of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors\n",
      "Since its inception, the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program has seen a remarkable increase in participation from universities across Sri Lanka. Hundreds of enthusiastic students now join hands to enhance their technical expertise while engaging with industry leaders. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, teams like **Team Sipsara** and **The Green Tycoon** recently represented Sri Lanka in the World Finals of Microsoft Imagine Cup 2023, showcasing the innovative capabilities of local talent. Team Sipsara developed a web-based application designed to measure and enhance the skills of children with Down Syndrome, while The Green Tycoon created \"CarboMeter,\" an alternative solution to monitor and achieve emission goals, contributing significantly to environmental sustainability. These students exemplify the program's aim to empower young minds to innovate solutions for pressing local and global issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Engaging the Tech Community\n",
      "Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors actively facilitate workshops and community events aimed at bridging the gap between academia and industry. Events such as the **Microsoft Build After Party 2023** and **Microsoft Ignite After Party 2022** have become cornerstones for networking and skill development, drawing students and tech enthusiasts together to learn and share knowledge.\n",

These students exemplify the program's aim to empower young minds to innovate solutions for pressing local and global issues.\n",

However, the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program addresses these pain points by providing a structured pathway for students to gain practical experience and connect with industry leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Opportunities for Expansion\n",
