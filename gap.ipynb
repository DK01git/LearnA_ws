      "Overview A well-designed form is a lot like a conversation. You're asking your users for information and you want them to submit their responses. However, designing a user-friendly form can be a tricky business. Knowing what makes users apprehensive, annoyed, or frustrated will give you the opportunity to make your forms more friendly and help to avoid frustration before it happens. Whether you're building a donation form, a registration form, or even a simple contact form, we want to help you create the best possible design. Why Are Forms Abandoned? As with any conversation, a first impression is important. When respondents see your form for the first time you want them to have a positive reaction and not get scared away by an overwhelming or disorganized form.  If they don't have a favorable first impression, your users might close the form before they even begin to fill it out. On top of that, your form should be clear and understandable, and there should be no question as to what you are asking for and why you are asking for it. These simple criteria are some of the most basic reasons forms get abandoned. Basic Features of User-Friendly Forms To begin, let's look at some quick and simple ways you can get your form off to a good, user-friendly start. The Title: The first thing anyone will see on your form is the title.  It should be clear, specific, and let the user know exactly where they are. Field Labeling: In general, field labels should be placed above or below your fields, and not to the left or the right.  This will make it much easier for your users to determine exactly what they are responding to when they're filling in your fields. Spacing:   Make sure to give your respondents plenty of space, both vertical and horizontal.  Adding space between items will make the form much less overwhelming. Styling: You can use our Theme Editor to give your form a simple style.  You should also make sure that the form shares a similar style with your website, email campaign, or wherever the user came from before opening the form.  This will make the user feel more confident and comfortable when giving information. Sections:  Breaking your form up into sections will help the users better understand the variety of questions you're asking them. Question Phrasing:   If a form is meant to be like a conversation, the way you phrase your questions can have a big impact. For example, instead of \"Date Available,\" why not ask, \"What day can you begin work?\" Pages: Like sections, pages can help split up your form and make it less intimidating.  Pages can also help users see the complete progression of the form, and give them a better idea of how long it will take to complete. Mobile-Friendly Layout:   If your form is likely to be viewed on mobile devices as well as computers, you should consider left-aligning the fields, which will make your form much easier to fill out on a smaller screen. Advanced Features: Part 1 Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to dig a little deeper and explore the more advanced features that will allow you to build more user-friendly forms. In this section, we will discuss the benefits of using conditional questions, repeated fields, and prefilling. Using Conditional Questions Within your form, you might have questions that are only relevant to certain users. By using conditional logic , you can hide these fields and only have them appear when they are needed. This helps you keep your form simple, so users won't be bogged down with irrelevant information. Repeated Fields You also have the option of setting up repeatable fields or sections . For example, if you're creating an RSVP form with the option to bring a guest, some users may want to enter the information for only one guest, whereas others might want to bring several guests. By using repeatable sections, you can eliminate extra fields and simplify your form. You can also customize the link to add a repeatable section and make it more friendly and specific to your form. Plus, you can limit the number of repeats by setting a maximum number. Prefilling Another great tool to help make long forms feel shorter is prefilling . There are several options for prefilling and if you'd like to learn more, we have an extensive collection of tutorials and examples within our Knowledge Base. Prefilling Through the URL:  If you are sending out a form link to your users, you can actually set up that link to prefill some of the information in your form. This way, when the user opens the form, part of the work will already be done for them. Prefilling Through a Connector:  If you have an Enterprise account with FormAssembly, you can set up our Salesforce and LDAP prefill connectors . These will allow you to pull information from Salesforce or your LDAP directory and prefill that data directly into your form. Prefilling With a Redirect URL:  You can utilize two forms with a connecting Redirect URL to prefill information from one form to the next . You can even use this method to gather information in one form, and then send it to a Salesforce Prefill Connector on the second form which displays Salesforce data! Advanced Features: Part 2 Now that you're familiar with some of our advanced features, let's move on and discuss how you can make forms more user-friendly by carefully selecting your questions, choosing required fields wisely, and using color choices that support the goals of your form. Question Selection For the most part, the questions you decide to ask will determine if your users complete or abandon your form. If you ask questions that are too personal, or if you're asking for sensitive data, this might cause respondents to have second thoughts about finishing your form. One way around this is to make those fields optional, so the user can skip them if they don't feel comfortable. Required Fields When you're writing questions and deciding what to make required , ask yourself: \"Is no response better than a made-up response?\" If users are not comfortable providing the information in a required field, they might invent an answer, or worse yet, abandon your form. Also, if you're using a CRM that requires certain fields, but you don't want to require them on your form, you can use post-processing formulas to ensure that your CRM does not error out. (For example  @IF this field is left blank, then fill it with a N/A .) Color Choices You should always be careful when adding color choices or background images to a form. Too much color can distract the users from the form or make it difficult to read. You don't want respondents to leave simply because your form had a distracting background image. When choosing colors, simpler is better. Pick 2 or 3 colors that are not harsh to look at and that compliment each other well.  Advanced Features: Part 3 Next, let's explore some additional advanced features that will help make the layout and design of your form even more user-friendly.  In this section, we will discuss the best-practice methods for displaying labels, hints, and multiple-choice fields. Labels When creating labels for your fields, make sure you are being clear and concise. You want your users to understand exactly what you mean, but you also don't want to add extra or needless information. For example, if you wanted to know a user's birthday, you may not want to have the label say \"DOB\" as some people might not understand the abbreviation. Alternatively, you don't need to use complicated wording, such as \"Please tell us the day you were born on, including the year.\" Instead, you can ask a simple question like \"When were you born?\" and include a helpful hint, if necessary. Hints You can use hints to help ensure that your users input information in the correct format, or offer additional information they need to easily and successfully complete the form fields. For instance, there are many different ways to format a date. If you need a particular format, use a hint underneath the field to show them exactly how you would like their response formatted. Multiple Choice Fields Choosing the right multiple-choice field is incredibly important in the design of your form. Imagine using radio buttons for a country selection question with over 180 options, or a dropdown menu with only two choices. Selecting the right type of multiple-choice question will increase the user-friendliness of your form. Below, you'll find some good tips to follow. Use radio buttons and menus for questions where you only want the respondent to select one item . Use checkboxes and lists for questions where you want the respondent to be able to select multiple items . For fields that only have a few possible responses, use radio buttons or checkboxes . For fields with many possible responses, use menus or lists . If you're using a list , users can make multiple selections by holding the CTRL key , so you might want to include that tip in a hint. Default Values Use default values on fields where you think most people will choose one answer over the others. For instance, if most of your respondents are going to be from the same country, you can save them the effort of selecting the country from a long drop-down menu. You can do this in the field's options menu within the Form Builder. Speaking of drop-down fields, who says the choices must be organized alphabetically? If most of the people responding are from the US or Canada, put those options at the top. If respondents are going to be from Sweden and Norway, put those countries at the top. This will save your users the time it takes to click and find the right choice. Quick Picks When deciding how to list your field choices, try to keep it as simple as possible and don't use any extra or special characters. For example, with drop-downs for states, it's great to be able to use your keyboard to choose an answer. When form builders decide to place characters in front of the choices, it's not possible to do so. Therefore, it's best to think twice before adding any extra characters that users might not expect. Key Points Order your questions thoughtfully. Use conditionals to show only the questions that are relevant. Don't limit how respondents can answer. Choose your questions carefully. By asking for too much, you might get nothing. Be simple and clear about what information you need. Anticipate questions and confusion. Be proactive! Test, test, and test again!\n",

Summary Client-side form validation Previous Overview: Web forms Next\n",
      "It is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format, before submitting user entered form data to the server. This client-side form validation helps ensure data entered matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.\n",
      "This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.\n",
      "Prerequisites:\n",
      "Computer literacy, a reasonable understanding of\n",
      " HTML ,\n",
      " CSS , and\n",
      " JavaScript .\n",
      "Objective:\n",
      "To understand what client-side form validation is, why it's important,\n",
      " and how to apply various techniques to implement it.\n",
      "Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.\n",
      "If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.\n",
      "However, client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform validation, including security checks, on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.\n",
      "Note: \n",
      "Read Website security for an idea of what could happen; implementing server-side validation is somewhat beyond the scope of this module, but you should bear it in mind.\n",
      "What is form validation? Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting.\n",
      "You'll get messages such as:\n",
      "\"This field is required\" (You can't leave this field blank).\n",
      "\"Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx\" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).\n",
      "\"Please enter a valid email address\" (the data you entered is not in the right format).\n",
      "\"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number.\" (A very specific data format is required for your data).\n",
      "This is called form validation .\n",
      "When you enter data, the browser (and the web server) will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.\n",
      "In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.\n",
      "If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.\n",
      "We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we insist on validating our forms?\n",
      "There are three main reasons:\n",
      "We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.\n",
      "We want to protect our users' data . Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.\n",
      "We want to protect ourselves . There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application. See Website security .\n",
      "Warning: \n",
      "Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request.\n",
      "Different types of client-side validation There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:\n",
      "HTML form validation \n",
      "HTML form attributes can define which form controls are required and which format the user-entered data must be in to be valid.\n",
      "JavaScript form validation \n",
      "JavaScript is generally included to enhance or customize HTML form validation.\n",
      "Client side validation can be accomplished with little to no JavaScript. HTML validation is faster than JavaScript, but is less customizable than JavaScript validation. It is generally recommended to begin your forms using robust HTML features, then enhance the user experience with JavaScript as needed. Using built-in form validation One of the most significant features of form controls is the ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript.\n",
      "This is done by using validation attributes on form elements.\n",
      "We've seen many of these earlier in the course, but to recap:\n",
      "required : Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.\n",
      "minlength and maxlength : Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).\n",
      "min , max , and step : Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types, and the increment, or step, for values, starting from the minimum.\n",
      "type : Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.\n",
      "pattern : Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.\n",
      "If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the attributes applied to the field, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid.\n",
      "When an element is valid, the following things are true:\n",
      "The element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements. The control will also match :user-valid if the user has interacted with the control, and may match other UI pseudo-classes, such as :in-range , depending on the input type and attributes.\n",
      "If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript).\n",
      "When an element is invalid, the following things are true:\n",
      "The element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class. If the user has interacted with the control, it also matches the :user-invalid CSS pseudo-class. Other UI pseudo-classes may also match, such as :out-of-range , depending on the error. These let you apply a specific style to invalid elements.\n",
      "If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form submission and display an error message. The error message will differ depending on the type of error. The Constraint Validation API is described below.\n",
      "Built-in form validation examples In this section, we'll test out some of the attributes that we discussed above. Simple start file Let's start with a simple example: an input that allows you to choose whether you prefer a banana or a cherry.\n",
      "This example involves a basic text <input> with an associated <label> and a submit <button> .\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <label for=\"choose\">Would you prefer a banana or cherry?</label>\n",
      " <input id=\"choose\" name=\"i-like\" />\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "css input:invalid {\n",
      " border: 2px dashed red;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "input:valid {\n",
      " border: 2px solid black;\n",
      "}\n",
      "To begin, make a copy of the fruit-start.html file found on GitHub in a new directory on your hard drive. The required attribute A common HTML validation feature is the required attribute.\n",
      "Add this attribute to an input to make an element mandatory.\n",
      "When this attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI pseudo-class and the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission, if the input is empty.\n",
      "While empty, the input will also be considered invalid, matching the :invalid UI pseudo-class.\n",
      "If any radio button in a same-named group has the required attribute, one of the radio buttons in that group must be checked for the group to be valid; the checked radio doesn't have to be the one with the attribute set.\n",
      "Note: \n",
      "Only require users to input data you need: For example, is it really necessary to know someone's gender or title?\n",
      "Add a required attribute to your input, as shown below.\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <label for=\"choose\">Would you prefer a banana or cherry? (required)</label>\n",
      " <input id=\"choose\" name=\"i-like\" required />\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "We added \"(required)\" to the <label> to inform the user that the <input> is required. Indicating to the user when form fields are required is not only good user experience, it is required by WCAG accessibility guidelines.\n",
      "We include CSS styles that are applied based on whether the element is required, valid, and invalid:\n",
      "css input:invalid {\n",
      " border: 2px dashed red;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "input:invalid:required {\n",
      " background-image: linear-gradient(to right, pink, lightgreen);\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "input:valid {\n",
      " border: 2px solid black;\n",
      "}\n",
      "This CSS causes the input to have a red dashed border when it is invalid and a more subtle solid black border when valid.\n",
      "We also added a background gradient when the input is required and invalid. Try out the new behavior in the example below:\n",
      "Try submitting the form from the live required example without a value. Note how the invalid input gets focus, a default error message (\"Please fill out this field\") appears, and the form is prevented from being sent. You can also see the source code on GitHub . Validating against a regular expression Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value.\n",
      "A regular expression (regexp) is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings, so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.\n",
      "Regexps are quite complex, and we don't intend to teach you them exhaustively in this article.\n",
      "Below are some examples to give you a basic idea of how they work.\n",
      "a — Matches one character that is a (not b , not aa , and so on).\n",
      "abc — Matches a , followed by b , followed by c .\n",
      "ab?c — Matches a , optionally followed by a single b , followed by c . ( ac or abc )\n",
      "ab*c — Matches a , optionally followed by any number of b s, followed by c . ( ac , abc , abbbbbc , and so on).\n",
      "a|b — Matches one character that is a or b .\n",
      "abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y , and so on).\n",
      "There are many more possibilities that we don't cover here.\n",
      "For a complete list and many examples, consult our Regular expression documentation.\n",
      "Let's implement an example.\n",
      "Update your HTML to add a pattern attribute like this:\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <label for=\"choose\">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>\n",
      " <input id=\"choose\" name=\"i-like\" required pattern=\"[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry\" />\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "input:invalid {\n",
      " border: 2px dashed red;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "input:valid {\n",
      " border: 2px solid black;\n",
      "}\n",
      "This gives us the following update — try it out:\n",
      "You can find this example live on GitHub along with the source code .\n",
      "In this example, the <input> element accepts one of four possible values: the strings \"banana\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", or \"Cherry\". Regular expressions are case-sensitive, but we've made it support capitalized as well as lower-case versions using an extra \"Aa\" pattern nested inside square brackets.\n",
      "At this point, try changing the value inside the pattern attribute to equal some of the examples you saw earlier, and look at how that affects the values you can enter to make the input value valid.\n",
      "Try writing some of your own, and see how it goes.\n",
      "Make them fruit-related where possible so that your examples make sense!\n",
      "If a non-empty value of the <input> doesn't match the regular expression's pattern, the input will match the :invalid pseudo-class. If empty, and the element is not required, it is not considered invalid.\n",
      "Some <input> element types don't need a pattern attribute to be validated against a regular expression. For example, specifying the email type validates the inputs value against a well-formed email address pattern or a pattern matching a comma-separated list of email addresses if it has the multiple attribute.\n",
      "Note: \n",
      "The <textarea> element doesn't support the pattern attribute.\n",
      "Constraining the length of your entries You can constrain the character length of all text fields created by <input> or <textarea> by using the minlength and maxlength attributes.\n",
      "A field is invalid if it has a value and that value has fewer characters than the minlength value or more than the maxlength value.\n",
      "Browsers often don't let the user type a longer value than expected into text fields. A better user experience than just using maxlength is to also provide character count feedback in an accessible manner and let the user edit their content down to size.\n",
      "An example of this is the character limit when posting on social media. JavaScript, including solutions using maxlength , can be used to provide this.\n",
      "Note: \n",
      "Length constraints are never reported if the value is set programmatically. They are only reported for user-provided input.\n",
      "Constraining the values of your entries For numeric fields, including <input type=\"number\"> and the various date input types, the min and max attributes can be used to provide a range of valid values.\n",
      "If the field contains a value outside this range, it will be invalid.\n",
      "Let's look at another example.\n",
      "Create a new copy of the fruit-start.html file.\n",
      "Now delete the contents of the <body> element, and replace it with the following:\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <div>\n",
      " <label for=\"choose\">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>\n",
      " <input\n",
      " type=\"text\"\n",
      " id=\"choose\"\n",

      " <div>\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      " </div>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "Here you'll see that we've given the text field a minlength and maxlength of six, which is the same length as banana and cherry.\n",
      "We've also given the number field a min of one and a max of ten.\n",
      "Entered numbers outside this range will show as invalid; users won't be able to use the increment/decrement arrows to move the value outside of this range.\n",
      "If the user manually enters a number outside of this range, the data is invalid.\n",
      "The number is not required, so removing the value will result in a valid value.\n",
      "input:invalid {\n",

      "Here is the example running live:\n",
      "Try this example live on GitHub and view the source code .\n",
      "Numeric input types, like number , range and date , can also take the step attribute. This attribute specifies what increment the value will go up or down by when the input controls are used (such as the up and down number buttons, or sliding the ranges thumb). The step attribute is omitted in our example, so the value defaults to 1 . This means that floats, like 3.2, will also show as invalid. Full example Here is a full example to show usage of HTML's built-in validation features.\n",

      "HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a <textarea> element)\n",
      "The Constraint Validation API makes the following properties available on the above elements.\n",
      "validationMessage : Returns a localized message describing the validation constraints that the control doesn't satisfy (if any). If the control is not a candidate for constraint validation ( willValidate is false ) or the element's value satisfies its constraints (is valid), this will return an empty string.\n",
      "validity : Returns a ValidityState object that contains several properties describing the validity state of the element. You can find full details of all the available properties in the ValidityState reference page; below is listed a few of the more common ones:\n",
      "patternMismatch : Returns true if the value does not match the specified pattern , and false if it does match. If true, the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class.\n",
      "tooLong : Returns true if the value is longer than the maximum length specified by the maxlength attribute, or false if it is shorter than or equal to the maximum. If true, the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class.\n",
      "tooShort : Returns true if the value is shorter than the minimum length specified by the minlength attribute, or false if it is greater than or equal to the minimum. If true, the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class.\n",
      "rangeOverflow : Returns true if the value is greater than the maximum specified by the max attribute, or false if it is less than or equal to the maximum. If true, the element matches the :invalid and :out-of-range CSS pseudo-classes.\n",
      "rangeUnderflow : Returns true if the value is less than the minimum specified by the min attribute, or false if it is greater than or equal to the minimum. If true, the element matches the :invalid and :out-of-range CSS pseudo-classes.\n",
      "typeMismatch : Returns true if the value is not in the required syntax (when type is email or url ), or false if the syntax is correct. If true , the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class.\n",
      "valid : Returns true if the element meets all its validation constraints, and is therefore considered to be valid, or false if it fails any constraint. If true, the element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class; the :invalid CSS pseudo-class otherwise.\n",
      "valueMissing : Returns true if the element has a required attribute, but no value, or false otherwise. If true, the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class.\n",

      "The Constraint Validation API also makes the following methods available on the above elements and the form element.\n",
      "checkValidity() : Returns true if the element's value has no validity problems; false otherwise. If the element is invalid, this method also fires an invalid event on the element.\n",
      "reportValidity() : Reports invalid field(s) using events. This method is useful in combination with preventDefault() in an onSubmit event handler.\n",
      "setCustomValidity(message) : Adds a custom error message to the element; if you set a custom error message, the element is considered to be invalid, and the specified error is displayed.

The message is shown to the user when reporting the problem.\n",

      "As you saw in the HTML validation constraint examples earlier, each time a user tries to submit an invalid form, the browser displays an error message. The way this message is displayed depends on the browser.\n",
      "These automated messages have two drawbacks:\n",
      "There is no standard way to change their look and feel with CSS.\n",
      "They depend on the browser locale, which means that you can have a page in one language but an error message displayed in another language, as seen in the following Firefox screenshot.\n",
      "Customizing these error messages is one of the most common use cases of the Constraint Validation API.\n",
      "Let's work through an example of how to do this.\n",
      "We'll start with some HTML (feel free to put this in a blank HTML file; use a fresh copy of fruit-start.html as a basis, if you like):\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <label for=\"mail\">\n",
      " I would like you to provide me with an email address:\n",
      " </label>\n",
      " <input type=\"email\" id=\"mail\" name=\"mail\" />\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "Add the following JavaScript to the page:\n",
      "js const email = document.getElementById(\"mail\");\n",
      "\n",
      "email.addEventListener(\"input\", (event) => {\n",
      " if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n",
      " email.setCustomValidity(\"I am expecting an email address!\");\n",
      " } else {\n",
      " email.setCustomValidity(\"\");\n",
      " }\n",
      "});\n",
      "Here we store a reference to the email input, then add an event listener to it that runs the contained code each time the value inside the input is changed.\n",
      "Inside the contained code, we check whether the email input's validity.typeMismatch property returns true , meaning that the contained value doesn't match the pattern for a well-formed email address. If so, we call the setCustomValidity() method with a custom message. This renders the input invalid, so that when you try to submit the form, submission fails and the custom error message is displayed.\n",
      "If the validity.typeMismatch property returns false , we call the setCustomValidity() method with an empty string. This renders the input valid, so the form will submit. During validation, if any form control has a customError that is not the empty string, form submission is blocked.\n",
      "You can try it out below:\n",
      "You can find this example live on GitHub as custom-error-message.html , along with the source code .\n",
      "Extending built-in form validation\n",
      "The previous example showed how you can add a customized message for a particular type of error ( validity.typeMismatch ).\n",
      "It is also possible to use all of the built in form validation, and then add to it using setCustomValidity() .\n",
      "Here we demonstrate how you can extend the built in <input type=\"email\"> validation to only accept addresses with the @example.com domain.\n",
      "We start with the HTML <form> below.\n",
      "html <form>\n",
      " <label for=\"mail\">Email address (@example.com only):</label>\n",
      " <input type=\"email\" id=\"mail\" />\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "The validation code is shown below.\n",
      "In the event of any new input the code first resets the custom validity message by calling setCustomValidity(\"\") .\n",
      "It then uses email.validity.valid to check if the entered address is invalid and if so, returns from the event handler.\n",
      "This ensures that all the normal built-in validation checks are run while the entered text is not a valid email address.\n",
      "Once the email address is valid, the code adds a custom constraint, calling setCustomValidity() with an error message if the address does not end with @example.com .\n",
      "js const email = document.getElementById(\"mail\");\n",
      "\n",
      "email.addEventListener(\"input\", (event) => {\n",
      " // Validate with the built-in constraints\n",
      " email.setCustomValidity(\"\");\n",
      " if (!email.validity.valid) {\n",
      " return;\n",
      " }\n",
      "// Extend with a custom constraints\n",
      " if (!email.value.endsWith(\"@example.com\")) {\n",
      " email.setCustomValidity(\"Please enter an email address of @example.com\");\n",
      " }\n",
      "});\n",
      "You can try this example in the page at the Live sample demo link .\n",
      "Try submitting an invalid email address, a valid email address that doesn't end in @example.com , and one that does end in @example.com .\n",
      "A more detailed example\n",
      "Now that we've seen a really basic example, let's see how we can use this API to build some slightly more complex custom validation.\n",
      "First, the HTML. Again, feel free to build this along with us:\n",
      "html <form novalidate>\n",
      " <p>\n",
      " <label for=\"mail\">\n",
      " <span>Please enter an email address:</span>\n",
      " <input type=\"email\" id=\"mail\" name=\"mail\" required minlength=\"8\" />\n",
      " <span class=\"error\" aria-live=\"polite\"></span>\n",
      " </label>\n",
      " </p>\n",
      " <button>Submit</button>\n",
      "</form>\n",
      "This form uses the novalidate attribute to turn off the browser's automatic validation. Setting the novalidate attribute on the form stops the form from showing its own error message bubbles, and allows us to instead display the custom error messages in the DOM in some manner of our own choosing.\n",
      "However, this doesn't disable support for the constraint validation API nor the application of CSS pseudo-classes like :valid , etc.\n",
      "That means that even though the browser doesn't automatically check the validity of the form before sending its data, you can still do it yourself and style the form accordingly.\n",
      "Our input to validate is an <input type=\"email\"> , which is required , and has a minlength of 8 characters. Let's check these using our own code, and show a custom error message for each one.\n",
      "We are aiming to show the error messages inside a <span> element.\n",
      "The aria-live attribute is set on that <span> to make sure that our custom error message will be presented to everyone, including it being read out to screen reader users.\n",
      "Now onto some basic CSS to improve the look of the form slightly, and provide some visual feedback when the input data is invalid:\n",
      "css body {\n",
      " font: 1em sans-serif;\n",
      " width: 200px;\n",
